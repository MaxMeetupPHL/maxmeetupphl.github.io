        community of Max users, digital artists and musicians. Each meetup will feature workshops, conversations, and

        attend. Attendees are encouraged to bring their computers if they wish to patch along with the workshops.

        The October meetup will feature a workshop by Sam Wells that focuses on several of the new features in Max 8.3
